# User Memory

- Most, if not all, of the user's apps are docker containers.
- Always consider Docker as the primary runtime for the user's apps. When providing setup, testing, or deployment instructions, default to Docker-based workflows unless the user requests otherwise.
- The user wants to do as little as possible. The agent should handle the bulk of the work, keep the user updated, and be as independent as possible without breaking things.
- Server address: ssh yancmo@ubuntumac
- User has given permission to connect to this server as needed.
