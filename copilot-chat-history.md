## Session Summaries

### July 2025

#### Dashboard Enhancement & Troubleshooting
- **Goal:** Upgrade dashboard to show real system stats, Docker container health, and modern UI.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Rewrote `dashboard.py` for real-time monitoring (psutil, Docker, health checks).
  - Enhanced `dashboard.html` template for modern look and categorized apps.
  - Fixed Dockerfile and docker-compose to avoid template mounting conflicts.
  - Resolved `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: app_card.html` by creating the missing template.
  - Diagnosed and fixed why Docker status was always `DOCKER_UNAVAILABLE` (needed to mount `/var/run/docker.sock`).
- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Docker socket not mounted = no container stats.
  - Template not updating = volume mount or build/copy conflict.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Always mount Docker socket for container monitoring.
  - Use a shared markdown file to document Copilot/AI chat for future reference.

#### VS Code Insiders Migration
- **Goal:** Move project and chat history to VS Code Insiders.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Copy project folder (including `.vscode` and hidden files).
  - Use Settings Sync for extensions/settings.
  - Export/copy chat history to `copilot-chat-history.md`.
  - Open in VS Code Insiders and verify.

#### Dashboard Docker Monitoring Fix & Template Troubleshooting
- **Issue:** All dashboard panels showed `DOCKER_UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Root Cause:** The dashboard container could not access the Docker daemon because `/var/run/docker.sock` was not mounted.
- **Solution:**
  - Added `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` to the dashboard service in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
  - Rebuilt and restarted the dashboard container.
  - Now, Docker status and resource stats are available in the dashboard.
- **Template Issue:**
  - Enhanced dashboard template changes were not showing up due to Docker build/copy conflicts.
  - Fixed by removing template copying from Dockerfile and relying on volume mount for live updates.
- **API Verification:**
  - `/api/health` and `/api/system` endpoints confirmed the enhanced dashboard was running.
  - `/api/apps` endpoint required config file path validation and error handling.
- **Best Practice:**
  - Always mount the Docker socket for container monitoring in development.
  - Use debug endpoints and API checks to verify which code version is running.

#### VS Code Insiders Migration Guidance
- **Steps Provided:**
  - Copy project folder (including `.vscode` and hidden files).
  - Use Settings Sync for extensions/settings.
  - Export/copy chat history to `copilot-chat-history.md`.
  - Open in VS Code Insiders and verify.
- **Tip:**
  - Keep this file updated after each major session for a living project memory.
