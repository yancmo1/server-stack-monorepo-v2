Rework my price watcher to $0 budget using only: (a) IMAP/Gmail API email parsing, (b) Playwright confirmation scrapers that capture network JSON for my specific watched sailings on Carnival and Royal, and (c) a simple HTML diff watcher for tricky promo pages. Store everything in SQLite. Run hourly with jitter, concurrency=1 per domain, and keep raw artifacts for audits. Alert me when the current total drops below my paid price or when a new applicable promo appears.
