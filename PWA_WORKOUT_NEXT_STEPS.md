# PWA Workout Features - Next Steps

## Current Status
The workout tracking functionality has been partially implemented in the 5K-tracker-PWA:

### âœ… Completed
- **Database Model**: `Workout` class added to `app.py` with comprehensive fields
- **Backend Routes**: Added 3 new routes:
  - `/workouts` - Display user workouts with pagination
  - `/add_workout` - Add new workout (form handling)
  - `/import_healthkit_workouts` - REST API for future HealthKit integration
- **Navigation**: Added "Workouts" link to main navbar in `base.html`
- **Mobile Optimization**: Fixed status bar overlap with iOS safe area CSS

### ðŸš§ Pending Work
- **Templates**: Need to create `workouts.html` and `add_workout.html` templates
- **Database Migration**: Need to run migration to add Workout table
- **Testing**: Need to test the new workout CRUD functionality

## Quick Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Templates (15 minutes)
Based on the existing `races.html` pattern, create:
- `templates/workouts.html` - List workouts with filters and pagination
- `templates/add_workout.html` - Form to add new workouts

### 2. Database Migration (5 minutes)
Since this is a new model, need to create the table:
```python
# In Flask shell or migration script
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

### 3. Test Functionality (10 minutes)
- Navigate to /workouts page
- Test adding a new workout
- Verify data persistence and display

## Ready for Implementation
All the hard work is done - just need the templates and a quick migration. The backend logic is complete and follows the same patterns as the existing race tracking functionality.

The PWA will then have full workout tracking capabilities without needing the iOS app or Apple Developer fees.
