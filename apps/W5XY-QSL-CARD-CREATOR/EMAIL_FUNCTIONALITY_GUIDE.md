## Technical Notes

### Email Address Sources
The application looks for email addresses in this order:
1. Email field in the QSO data
2. Email field in ADIF import data
3. Manual entry in the email dialog

### Browser Compatibility
- Gmail web interface works with all modern browsers
- Requires you to be logged into Gmail in your default browser

### Email Client Compatibility
- Works with any email client configured as your system default
- Tested with Mail.app (macOS), Outlook, Thunderbird

### Data Privacy
- No email data is stored or transmitted by the application
- All email composition happens locally on your computer
- HAMQTH lookup opens their website directly (external service)

## Troubleshooting

### Email Dialog Doesn't Open
- Ensure you have selected a QSO from the list
- Check that the QSO data contains valid information

### Gmail Doesn't Open
- Ensure you have a default browser set
- Check that you're logged into Gmail in your browser
- Some browsers may block popup windows - allow popups for the application

### Email Client Doesn't Open
- Ensure you have a default email client configured in your system
- Check your system's email client settings

### Missing QSO Information
- Check that your ADIF file contains complete QSO data
- Some fields may show as "Unknown" if not present in the original data

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Direct email sending (SMTP) without external clients
- Automatic QSL card PDF attachment
- Email templates customization
- Email address database integration
- Bulk email operations for multiple QSOs
