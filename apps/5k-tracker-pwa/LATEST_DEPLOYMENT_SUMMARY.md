# 5K Tracker PWA Deployment ‚Äì Latest Summary (as of August 3, 2025)

## üü¢ Current State
- **PWA Flask app is running** in Docker, healthy, and accessible on port 5555.
- **Nginx config is correct**: `/tracker/pwa/` is proxied to `localhost:5555` with the right rewrite and `X-Script-Name` header.
- **PrefixMiddleware is active** in the Flask app, rewriting paths for subpath hosting.
- **Database is shared**: Both the original tracker and PWA use the same PostgreSQL DB and see the same data.
- **No more Flask route errors**: The app starts cleanly and logs PrefixMiddleware output.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Fixed
- Removed invalid `@app.route('')` (which caused Flask to crash).
- Added a robust catch-all route:
  ```python
  @app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
  @app.route('/<path:path>')
  def catch_all(path):
      # ...existing code...
  ```
- Removed unnecessary `/tracker/pwa` and `/tracker/pwa/` routes that caused redirect loops or confusion.
- Ensured PrefixMiddleware is the first WSGI middleware and logs every request‚Äôs `SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO`.

## üö¶ What‚Äôs Left / Next Steps
- **Rebuild and redeploy the PWA container** after the latest code changes.
- **Reload Nginx** if you make any further config changes.
- **Test `/tracker/pwa/` in your browser or with curl**. You should see the PWA frontend, not a 404.
- **Check PWA container logs** for lines like:
  ```
  [PrefixMiddleware] SCRIPT_NAME: /tracker/pwa, PATH_INFO: /
  Catch-all route hit: 
  ```
- If you still see a 404, share the latest logs and I‚Äôll help you finish the last step.

**You are now one redeploy away from a working PWA at `/tracker/pwa/`!**
