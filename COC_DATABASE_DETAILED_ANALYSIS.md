## Database Technical Details

### Table Sizes and Constraints:
- **Primary Keys:** All tables properly configured
- **Foreign Keys:** CWL tables reference players(name)
- **Indexes:** 20 indexes for performance optimization
- **Sequences:** All auto-increment fields properly configured

### Data Integrity Checks:
âœ… All player names unique  
âœ… All player tags unique (where provided)
